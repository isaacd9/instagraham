  question on the application form that we really care about is the one
  where we ask what cool things you've made. If what you've made is
  version one of a promising startup, so much the better, but the main
  thing we care about is whether you're good at making things. Being lead
  developer of a popular open source project counts almost as

  looking for finished, smooth presentations. They're looking for raw
  talent. All you need to convince them of is that you're smart and that
  you're onto something good. If you try too hard to conceal your
  rawnessby trying to seem corporate, or pretending to know about stuff
  you don'tyou may just conceal your talent.",
